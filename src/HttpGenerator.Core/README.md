# HTTP File Generator Core Library

Core library used by the HttpGenerator CLI tool for generating `.http` files for the popular REST Client IDE extension

`.http` files were made populate by the Visual Studio Code extension [REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client), which then was adopted by JetBrains IDE's, and later on [Visual Studio 2022](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MadsKristensen.RestClient)
